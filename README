NVMC: NEAT VM CLUSTER
=====================

Neat VM Cluster (NVMC; pronounced nivmec) is a collection of shell
scripts for managing KVM virtual machines on multiple host nodes.  It
uses Qemu directly and stores host and VM configurations in the file
system.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================

NVMC uses the following directories on the master node:

+ NCDIR: NVMC's base directory (/var/nc).
+ NCDIR/hosts: contains a directory for each host.
+ NCDIR/vms: contains a directory for each VM.

The directory NCDIR/hosts/HOST stores the details of host node HOST:
+ ADDR: the address of the host.
+ CPUS: the number of available CPUS.
+ MEMS: available memory in GB.

The directory NCDIR/vms/VM stores the details of VM:
+ CPUS: the number of CPUS assigned to VM.
+ MEMS: the amount of VM's memory in GB.
+ DISK: the size of VM's disk in GB.
+ HOST: the host on which the VM is running.
+ USER: the UID of VM owner.
+ INIT: VM initialization script (executed when creating the VM).
+ ONCE: commands executed only once (e.g. for resizing disk; optional).
+ QEMU: Qemu invocation script (optional; NCDIR/QEMU is used by default).
+ OPTS: extra Qemu arguments.
+ SLOT: the slot assigned to the VM (created by nc push).
+ disk: VM's disk image in QCOW2 format (created on the host node).

EXECUTABLES
===========

The main programs:
+ nc: the main program.
+ ncvm: executed on host nodes for managing VMs.
+ nclogin: for user login.

Helpers:
+ nc_mkuser.sh: make a VM user.
+ nc_mkvm.sh: make a VM.
+ nc_backup.sh: create a backup of NCDIR.

For VM users:
+ users/nctun.sh: create a SSH/VNC tunnel to a VM.
+ users/nctun.cmd: create a VNC tunnel to a VM for windows.
+ users/vmdisk.sh: extend partition after enlarging VM disk.

SETTING UP
==========

NVMC is executed on a master node to manage virtual machines on
multiple host nodes.  The root user of the master node should be able
to log into host nodes using its public key.  On host nodes Qemu/KVM
and socat should be available.  Host nodes can be on a private
network, visible only to the master node, through which the users may
connect to the VMs.

+ Install NVMC on the master node (make install)
+ Add a directory in NCDIR/hosts/ for each host, containing ADDR, CPUS, MEMS.
+ Install NVMC on host nodes (nc hostinit)
+ Create VM users (nc_mkuser.sh)
+ Create VMs (nc_mkvm.sh)

The script nc_mkvm.sh assumes that disk images are stored in
NCDIR/imgs directory on host nodes.
